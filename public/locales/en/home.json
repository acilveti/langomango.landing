  "description": "As every night, I took my Kindle to enjoy reading for an hour, when I realized that I was reading Game of Thrones almost entirely in Swedish. I had become so accustomed to reading like this that it had become the new normal for me.\n\nHow amazing is it that through my main hobby, I was able to understand a new language? Even more remarkable, after several attempts with other apps and private tutors, I was sure I wasn't able to stick to learning. This time however, it was not boring, it has become a enjoyable habit for me. What a wonderfull feeling."
